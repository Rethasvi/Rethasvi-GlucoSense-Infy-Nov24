# GlucoSense- AI-Powered Diabetes Detection for Early Intervention
## Overview:
Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease linked to elevated blood sugar levels and can lead to severe complications if untreated. Early detection is crucial for effective management and prevention. This project leverages machine learning to create a robust predictive model for early diabetes diagnosis based on patient symptoms. Using various machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict the likelihood of diabetes with high accuracy, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in rapid diagnosis.

## Objectives:
* Analyze diabetes disease patterns and understand contributing factors.
* Identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes based on symptoms.
* Develop an efficient, accurate model to predict diabetes from symptom data.
* Provide real-time predictions to support timely healthcare interventions.
* Determine the most significant symptoms contributing to diabetes risk.
* Deliver a comprehensive platform with detailed information on diabetes types, causes, wellness advice, and commonly used medications.
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics and ROC curves.
